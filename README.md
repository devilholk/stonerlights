stonerlights
============

This project aims to control a bunch of (so far) local RGB LED's and other LED related devices.

This project is recently started and it puzzled together from old learning experiences so for now the structure is not the best.
Some parts may have separate licenses, I have not yet examined those legal details, if this applies it is stated in those files.

Be patient
