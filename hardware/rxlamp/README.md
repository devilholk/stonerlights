This is the kicad schematics and board layout for one of the lamps.
The LED's are bought from ledz.com the other parts are availble at a bunch of places though I got it from digikey.com and some parts from ebay.

I have also used models and libraries from http://smisioto.no-ip.org/elettronica/kicad/kicad-en.htm
There you can download 3D models for this design
